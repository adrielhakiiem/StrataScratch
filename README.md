# StrataScratch

This repo contains my solutions to StrataScratch SQL and Python (pandas) interview-style questions, organized by difficulty. Each notebook includes problem descriptions, code, and explanations to reinforce concepts and track progress.

Topics covered include joins, groupbys, window functions, string manipulation, and data cleaning â€” using real-world questions from companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

Tools: SQL, pandas, Jupyter Notebook.
